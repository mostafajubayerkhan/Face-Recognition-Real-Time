# Face-Recognition-Real-Time
This is a Python (intermediate level) project for recognizing human face with OpenCV (Computer Vision).  The model can identify human particular human faces (multiple)  in a live webcam video stream. 

The model completes following major steps----- 
1. Running video read to check webcam
2. Using haar cascase classifier to check the camera for recognizing human face.
3. Opening up the camera to extract your face from video frames multiple time and store faces of multiple persons.
4. Finally, detecting individual face from the dataset stored with a rectanggular box which would show identified person's name writtern top of the face.
